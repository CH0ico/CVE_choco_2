# DESCRIPTION

- During the security assessment of "STUDENT WEB PORTAL", I detected a critical SQL injection vulnerability in the "signup.php" file. This vulnerability is attributed to the insufficient valreg_passwdation of reg_passwd input for the "reg_passwd" parameter. This inadequacy enables attackers to inject malicious SQL queries. Consequently, attackers can access the database without proper authorization, modify or delete data, and obtain sensitive information. Immediate corrective actions are essential to safeguard system security and uphold data integrity.
